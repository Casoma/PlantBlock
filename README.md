# Open Modular Grow Box System

## Design and Concept Phase

Welcome to our open modular grow box system project. We are currently in the design and concept phase, and we are looking for people to join us in this effort.

Our open modular grow box system is a versatile, customizable, and scalable solution for indoor farming that allows you to track, monitor, and automate your plant growth in a controlled environment, optimize yields, and increase efficiency.

We believe that this project has the potential to revolutionize the indoor farming industry, and we want you to be a part of it. We are looking for designers, developers, and anyone who is passionate about indoor farming and wants to help us create a world-class open modular grow box system.

If you are interested in joining our efforts, please contact us at cannahaus@systemli.org. We would love to hear from you and discuss how you can contribute to our project.

Stay tuned for updates as we move forward with the design and development of our open modular grow box system. We are excited about the potential of this project and look forward to working with you to make it a reality.

Thank you for your interest in our open modular grow box system. Let's create something amazing together.
